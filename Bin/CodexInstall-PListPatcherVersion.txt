Codex IDE Expert - PListPatcher Edition
---------------------------------------

These are install instructions for the "PListPatcher Edition" release of Codex. The binary for the expert is named: Codex.dll

This edition has been retained only for those using Delphi Tokyo 10.2 or Delphi Tokyo 10.2.1. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to 10.2.3 which has support for iPhone X display

To install, I suggest using either GExperts' Expert Manager, or create a registry entry with a string value in:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Embarcadero\BDS\19.0\Experts

With the value pointing to wherever you have copied the dll. Either way, you will need to restart Delphi.

Codex installs to a menu item in the Tools menu in Delphi.

***** Note that you will need to configure PList Patcher as per the documentation below. *****

Apologies for the scant documentation; I haven't had much time to do any as yet.

Builder menu item:

Allows compile/build of all projects in a group, for either debug and/or release, for whichever selected platforms are available.


PList Patcher:

Shows options for PList Patcher, namely:

* Whether PList Patcher is enabled
* If messages should be sent to the IDE (e.g. when a .info.plist file is patched, or when an exception occurs while patching)
* Path to the patch file

A patch file for configuration of iPhoneX launch images is located at:

  https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/KastriFree/tree/master/Configuration/iPhoneXImagesPListPatch.xml

Please refer to this article regarding creation/deployment of the image files:

Using PList Patcher, you can ignore the parts about creating a custom .info.plist, as PList Patcher does the work of patching the file for you.
