Codex IDE Expert
----------------

**** NOTE: There's a known issue which occasionally causes AV's on shutdown of the IDE - this is being looked into ****

Use CodexSetup.exe to install Codex, which includes support for Delphi 10.1 Berlin and Delphi 10.2 Tokyo.

Codex installs to a menu item in the Tools menu in Delphi. Better documentation is coming, meanwhile..

Release 0.0.1:

* Adds an option for startup, loading the last project opened before the IDE was last shut down 
* Adds an option for showing a Favorites menu under the file menu, which uses the GExperts Favorite Files data (requires GExperts)
* Adds an option for deleting .stat files from projects (at present, not as reliable as it could be)
* Adds an option for adjusting the Project Options dialog so that the height does not exceed the working height of the display
* Adds 2 menu items to the Codex submenu, for showing specific parts of the IDE options, namely SDK Manager, and Environment Variables
* Adds an Image Assets option for scanning image files that match the requirements for icons/splash images for mobile projects
