Codex IDE Expert
----------------

At present, I have built this expert for Delphi 10.2 Tokyo only, as it is undecided as to whether I may seek to have some or all of it integrated into GExperts, or have it as a completely standalone expert.

It has been released mainly to assist users with auto-patching of .info.plist files in order to support iPhone X

To install, I suggest using either GExperts' Expert Manager, or create a registry entry with a string value in:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Embarcadero\BDS\19.0\Experts

With the value pointing to wherever you have copied the dll. Either way, you will need to restart Delphi.

Codex installs to a menu item in the Tools menu in Delphi.

***** Note that you will need to configure PList Patcher as per the documentation below. *****

Apologies for the scant documentation; I haven't had much time to do any as yet.


Builder menu item:

Allows compile/build of all projects in a group, for either debug and/or release, for whichever selected platforms are available.


PList Patcher:

Shows options for PList Patcher, namely:

* Whether PList Patcher is enabled
* If messages should be sent to the IDE (e.g. when a .info.plist file is patched, or when an exception occurs while patching)
* Path to the patch file

A patch file for configuration of iPhoneX launch images is located at:

  https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/KastriFree/tree/master/Configuration/iPhoneXImagesPListPatch.xml

Please refer to this article regarding creation/deployment of the image files:

  http://delphiworlds.com/2017/11/supporting-iphone-x-display-with-delphi/

Using PList Patcher, you can ignore the parts about creating a custom .info.plist, as PList Patcher does the work of patching the file for you.
