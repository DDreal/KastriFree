Codex IDE Expert
----------------

**** NOTE: There's a known issue with the CodexD10T.dll which causes AV's on shutdown of the IDE - this is being looked into ****

These are install instructions for the "official" release of Codex. The binary for the expert is named: CodexD10T.dll

At present, I have built this expert for Delphi 10.2 Tokyo only, as it is undecided as to whether I may seek to have some or all of it integrated into GExperts, or have it as a completely standalone expert.

To install, I suggest using either GExperts' Expert Manager, or create a registry entry with a string value in:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Embarcadero\BDS\19.0\Experts

With the value pointing to wherever you have copied the dll. Either way, you will need to restart Delphi.

Codex installs to a menu item in the Tools menu in Delphi.

Documentation is coming, though some of the functionality is self-explanatory
